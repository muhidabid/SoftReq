https://github.com/muhidabid/SoftReq/assets/82958857/3ab94eee-ab0c-4b4e-a762-7f1bd1566790

## ✅ Features
- Track your software development projects according to workspaces and projects.
- Organize requirements for each project within a Kanban view for easy visualization.
- Add Requirement Attributes (Priority, Status, Legal Liability, Cross-Reference)
- Extract Quality Concerns.
- Detect Requirement Ambiguities.
- Check for Requirement redundancies


## 🏃 How to Run
#### Prerequisites
1. Install angular cli
2. Set up a Mongo database with a 'Workspaces' collection with a sample workspace of the type:

````
{
	name: {type: String},
	description: {type: String},
	projectsRef: {
		type: [ObjectId],
		index: true,
 		ref: 'Projects'
	},
}
````

3. Replace your MongoDB URL in `DEVELOPMENT\backend-express\config\db.js`

#### Running the Application

**"0. DEVELOPMENT"** This folder is the main development folder of our project.

In `0. DEVELOPMENT\client-angular`, to start Angular server:

    npm install
	ng serve

In `0. DEVELOPMENT\client-angular\src`, to start Express server:

    node server.js

In `0. DEVELOPMENT\client-angular\backend-python`, to start Python server: 

    python flask-apis.py

Open a new tab on your local browser and go to http://localhost:4200/home-page

## 🧭 Navigating the Application
Once you run the SoftReq application, you will be at the home page. Go to 'Dashboard' from the menu where you can create new workspaces to keep track of your projects.

#### Creating a New Workspace:

- Click on the ‘Workspace +’ button on the left side bar of the screen. In the pop-up window that opened, enter a name for your workspace and a small description. 

- Click on ‘Create Workspace’ to go to the new workspace.

#### Creating a New Project:

From within a workspace, multiple projects can be created. 

- Go to the workspace where you want to add a new project.

- Click on the ‘Create New Project’ button. In the pop-up window that opened, enter a name for the project and a small description.

- Click on ‘Create Project’.

- Click on the newly-created project in the center of the screen.

#### Adding Requirements

From within a project, multiple user requirements can be assigned to that project.

User requirements can be added to the default list (‘ExampleList’, the gray component shown on the left side of the screen) , or different lists can be created to categorize requirements as needed. New lists can be created using the purple ‘New List’ button on the upper right corner of the screen.

To add user requirements to a list: 
- Click on the ‘+’ button inside any list. In the pop-up that opens, write a single requirement, then click ‘Confirm’.

Once requirements are created, you can: 

- Click on ‘Extract Quality Concerns’ to see its requirement classification.

- Click on the pencil icon to add attributes to the requirement.

- Drag and drop a requirement from one list to another.

- See all requirements in the backlog view to organize into sprints.
